# StockMarketPrediction-Unsupervised-KMean-Deployment-Heroku

This Repository talks about the stock market prediction based on the dataset which does not have label. Hence there is a need for a model which can predict from the input features based on the similar properties and group them into a clusters . Kmean Algorithm is used in order to predict the model . Further the web framework is created using Flask and deployed it on to the Heroku platform 

Please find below the deployable link for your reference:

Here based on the clusters , the result will be displayed in the groups:
